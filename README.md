## Background

Unified Shared Services Management (USSM) within the GSA Office of
Governmentwide Policy (OGP), in partnership with the Information
Technology Category (ITC) within GSA, Federal Acquisition Service (FAS)
is seeking to obtain a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that
includes functionality for Payroll and Work Schedule and Leave
Management (WSLM). The posted draft RFQ will help leverage the scale of
the Federal Government and enable agencies to focus resources (human and
fiscal) on core mission priorities, which will reduce costs,
significantly improve security posture, increase user experience and
service, and better manage budgets.

## What we're hoping to end up with

USSM is requesting industry feedback on the draft RFQ. Some areas for
focus are:

-   What recommendations do you have that would assist the Federal
    Government ensure a successful implementation and migration to SaaS?

-   From your experience, how long should the Federal Government expect
    it to take to complete the migration and implementation activities?

-   What would you suggest the government use as Key Performance
    Indicators (KPI) for SaaS?

-   What activities should the Federal Government undertake to manage
    costs - both for implementation and ongoing subscription fees?
