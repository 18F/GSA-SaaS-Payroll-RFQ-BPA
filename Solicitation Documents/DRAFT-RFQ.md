## Draft RFQ

### Solicitation Number: 47QTCA-18-Q-0001

**December 15, 2017**

## Table of Contents


## Purpose

The purpose of this Statement of Objectives (SOO) document is to obtain
a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that includes functionality for
Payroll and Work Schedule and Leave Management (WSLM). Moving to
cloud-based technology (e.g., SaaS) will leverage the scale of the
Federal Government and enable agencies to focus resources (human and
fiscal) on core mission priorities, which will reduce costs,
significantly improve security posture, increase user experience and
service, and better manage budgets. The Federal Government anticipates
the streamlining of employee time reporting and payroll processing using
standard Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and data schemas to
support data exchanges between legacy Human Resource and Financial
Management systems and the SaaS solutions. This approach will allow the
Federal Government’s Shared Services Providers (SSPs) to provide this
Information Technology (IT) solution, along with IT professional
services that support customer agencies within the Federal Government.

Employee time reporting and payroll processing includes calculating
employees’ gross pay and determining eligibility for certain pay
flexibilities and benefits (e.g., overtime, hazard pay, retirement
plans), leave accruals and usage, pre-tax and post-tax deductions, and
order of precedence for calculating gross-to-net pay. There are likely
thousands of business rules associated with the various pay plans,
employee types, leave codes, and other factors that impact Payroll and
WSLM. The identification of all applicable business rules will be
determined during the implementation phase when the fit-gap analysis is
conducted between the core payroll processing application and
customer-specific requirements/rules/needs.

The Federal Government intends to utilize the General Services
Administration (GSA) IT Schedule 70 acquisition vehicle to establish a
multiple award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) in accordance with
procedures found in FAR Subpart 8.4.

## Scope of Work

The scope of this multiple award BPA includes SaaS solutions and
associated implementation support for Payroll, WSLM, or both. Awards
will be made in three \[pools\]:

1.  Payroll SaaS solutions and associated implementation support;

2.  WSLM SaaS solutions and associated implementation support; and

3.  A combined offering of Payroll and WSLM SaaS solutions and
    associated implementation support.

The implementation approach will be coordinated at the program level
encompassing the executive agencies within the Federal Government. The
Payroll approach will include phases that group agencies with similar
workforce needs. It is expected that the first phase will require the
most preparation and effort, and subsequent implementation phases will
be expedited based on the existence of infrastructure and APIs. WSLM
implementations will occur as needed by agencies.

Migration of Federal agencies to leading-edge solutions that reduce
security risks and maximize agency focus on mission can be accomplished
through leveraging commercial technology for common administrative
functions. The vision for acquiring, implementing, and managing modern,
sustainable, and innovative federal payroll systems is based on
standards, modern technology, and optimized service delivery.

## Ordering Period and Place of Performance

The Ordering Period will be five years (no option periods). The services
specified in this solicitation shall be performed at various locations
across the continental United States and will be specified in the BPA
calls. The BPAs for WSLM will be open to orders from all Federal
agencies. BPA calls for Payroll processing and “Both” (Payroll and WSLM)
processing will be limited to the current federal Payroll SSPs.

## Background

In the early 2000s, the Federal Government launched the e-Payroll
initiative to streamline payroll processing government-wide. The
initiative resulted in the establishment of four designated Federal
Government Payroll SSPs: 1) Department of Defense (DoD), Finance and
Accounting Service (DFAS); 2) United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA), National Finance Center (NFC); 3) Department of the Interior
(Interior), Interior Business Center (IBC); and 4) General Services
Administration, Payroll Services Branch (GSA-PSB). Additionally, the
Department of State (State) was permitted to continue independent
payroll operations to support overseas civilian employees. The four SSPs
and State serve approximately 2.3 million employees globally using a
range of IT systems (See Table 1), including internally developed and
maintained software and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products. The
SSPs operate independent systems in disparate environments and in
centers located throughout the continental US.

At last count, the Federal Government was using over 108 WSLM systems.
The Human Resources Line of Business (HRLOB) at the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) estimated that only 52 percent of Federal agencies
obtained WSLM systems from a SSP. The anticipated basis of the future
model is to drive scale and efficiency for customer agencies by
providing standard business capabilities that the Federal Government has
agreed on and will abide by. This will reduce the current 4 Payroll
solutions and 108 WSLM systems to a smaller number of government-wide
solutions.

## Performance Objectives


Payroll and WSLM customers serviced by the SSPs desire Payroll and WSLM
solutions that are low cost, flexible, configurable, end-user friendly,
and current with statute and policy requirements. The HRLOB Strategic
Framework has the goal of providing a common user experience across
Federal agencies. The modernization of Payroll and WSLM solutions aligns
with this goal. The modernization of Payroll and WSLM will also assist
in achieving improved human capital outcomes (e.g., accurate and timely
payments), enhanced human resources IT sustainability (e.g., current
technology operating securely), and increased cost savings.

## Solution Objectives


The Government seeks Payroll and/or WSLM SaaS solutions that:

1.  Provide the baseline business capabilities and accommodate the data
    standards identified in the Federal Integrated Business
    Framework (FIBF) for Payroll and/or WSLM as identified in
    **Attachment A - Business Capabilities and Data Standards.**
    (Additional information can be found in the HRLOB Business Reference
    Model)[^1];

2.  Continuously operate within federal legislative and policy
    compliance;

3.  Have a process that allows for implementation of new or additional
    capabilities federal agencies identify outside of specific requiring
    legislation (change request);

4.  Is uniform across all Federal ordering agencies while still allowing
    for configuration at the individual agency level for
    administratively determined requirements. The solution shall
    consistently adhere to the statutory requirements defined in the
    authorizing title (e.g., Title 5), but allow agencies that have been
    granted authority to “administratively determine” certain components
    of compensation to have deviations from the standard outline (e.g.,
    agencies may be required to compensate employees under Title 5, but
    be allowed to “administratively determine” rates of pay for hard to
    fill positions or authorize leave accruals that exceed title
    requirements for emergency personnel, etc. in the agency’s
    authorizing statute);

5.  Enable interoperability between Federal agencies’ finance, payroll,
    WSLM and other supporting systems through modern interfaces, APIs
    and other technologies and strategies that comport to data standards
    agreed to by the federal community;

6.  Provide for a Federal Government-wide Payroll and WSLM platform(s)
    with roadmaps and plans addressing next generation human capital
    management challenges and opportunities through technologies such as
    blockchain, data lakes, big data analytics, and artificial
    intelligence;

7.  Deliver all maintenance upgrades, updates, and patches required to
    the product as part of the SaaS capability upon successful
    acceptance testing by the responsible Federal agency(s);

8.  Satisfy Federal agencies desire to always be in the “Supported
    Configuration” of the supplier, including any integration(s) with
    aforementioned systems or technologies (e.g., Federal agencies are
    deployed on the most current version and not lagging behind
    supported software versions);

9.  Comply with technology, security, data and interoperability,
    identity management, accessibility, service desk and support
    constraints and capabilities described in **Attachment B - Technical
    Capabilities**;

10. Comply with the roles identified in the draft RACI chart in
    **Attachment D - RACI Chart** when delivering the solution; and

11. Provide automated service management and monitoring tools for the
    Federal Government SSP’s to maintain operating awareness.

## Services Objectives


The Federal Government also seeks the IT professional support services
as follows:

### Business Support Services

1.  **Program Management (PM)**: Support services that include the
    creation of project management artifacts in accordance with the
    Unified Shared Services Management (USSM) M3 Framework[^2] and
    *Project Management Book of Knowledge* (PMBOK) best practices.

2.  **Implementation:** Support services that include the management and
    implementation of the onboarding of customer agencies to the
    SaaS solution.

3.  **Configuration**: Support services that include the cataloguing,
    design, and/or adjustment to inherently flexible parameters within
    software that meet one or more defined requirements. An ability to
    apply these configurations “out-of-the-box,” usually without coding
    and the configuration to be readily changeable throughout the
    lifecycle of the service.

4.  **Data integration**: Data integration services involve the
    creation, design, and/or implementation of automated connections
    between the system of the supplier and agency’s databases
    and systems. These support services include the intake of human
    capital data necessary to compute pay (e.g., grade, post of duty
    location, special rate). The creation, design, and/or implementation
    of automated interfaces between a Quoter’s system and an ordering
    agency’s human resource databases and/or a government-wide
    implementation of employee master data are required. Data
    integration also involves data migration that includes the
    replication or movement of payroll data, which contains employee
    data, WSLM data, source files, audit trails, and/or other key fields
    and content. Payroll data also includes audit history data and
    reconstructed audit trails of existing records from existing agency
    systems to the Quoter’s system.

5.  **Transition:** There are two types of transitions that will occur
    during the period of performance: Transition-In and Transition-Out.
    Transition-In includes Federal agencies migrating from one Service
    Management Organization (e.g., Federal SSP) to another where there
    will be a change of Payroll and/or WSLM SaaS solutions. The solution
    providers (losing and gaining) shall take all actions necessary to
    achieve a successful transition of the customer agency from the
    current solution set to the new solution set.

> Transition-Out describes the end of the task ordering period. During
> Transition-Out, all contractors with active task orders shall
> coordinate their Phase-Out Transition Plan activities with the
> incoming contractor(s). Should the BPA or task orders be terminated
> prior to the end of the scheduled period of performance, or the follow
> on contract action is not awarded with enough time to allow a full
> transition, the contractors shall transfer all project materials to
> the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) within two weeks after
> the COR’s request. The Quoter shall identify how it will coordinate
> and communicate a seamless process to Transition-In and
> Transition-Out.

### Training Support Services

1.  **Training**: Services include the development of training materials
    and programs to ensure that all users can use the systems based on
    their assigned roles (e.g., current payroll providers and agencies
    obtaining WSLM systems).

2.  **Help desk support**: Help desk support for technical and
    configuration issues within the SaaS solutions as defined in the
    Service Desk and Support tab of **Attachment B - Technical
    Capabilities**.

3.  **User Support and Management**: The education, training,
    communication, tools, instructions, and active guidance provided to
    users of the contractor’s system during the migration and
    operating periods. Support and management include the communication
    plans and methods for communicating with end users when necessary.

## Constraints

### Security

1.  As indicated in the Security tab in **Attachment B - Technical
    Capabilities**, the contractor shall obtain a Federal Risk and
    Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) authorization for its
    solution within one year of BPA award date and it shall be
    maintained throughout the duration of the BPA.

2.  The Quoter shall comply with the additional security capabilities
    listed in the Security tab in **Attachment B - Technical
    Capabilities**.

3.  The Task Order Authorizing Official for a particular system or
    application has the authority to deny, terminate, or alter access to
    the Quoter’s system or application if the level of risk is increased
    by granting such access.

### Data Rights

1.  **Unrestricted Rights to Data** - Federal agencies will retain
    unrestricted rights to all Government data and maintain the rights
    to request full copies in a format that is readily accessible
    through predominant industry and/or open data formats to which
    federal agencies agree at any time.

2.  **Data Availability** – National Archives and Records
    Administration (NARA) official records must be available to federal
    agencies upon request no more than 30 days from initial request. Ad
    hoc requests for data must be available within 5 business days or
    within the timeframe negotiated on the task order and in a format to
    which the Federal agency agrees.

3.  **Data Ownership** - All data collected in the system is the
    property of the United States Federal Government, but is not
    necessarily limited to Payroll and WSLM data, it may include account
    information, permissions, login activity, and other supporting data
    that enables the system to meet the objectives of this BPA. If the
    solution has unique data rights or ownership issues, special
    language may be authorized by the ordering Federal agency.

#### Assumptions and Exceptions

The Quoter shall state any assumptions and exceptions to the
requirements, terms, and conditions contained in this Request for
Quotation (RFQ). Please note that any exceptions to the requirements of
this BPA may adversely affect the evaluation of the quote and the quote
may be deemed unacceptable.

## 508 Compliance Requirements

Unless the Federal Government invokes an exemption, all Electronic and
Information Technology (EIT) products and services provided shall fully
comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, per the 1998
Amendments, 29 U.S.C. 794d, and the Architectural and Transportation
Barriers Compliance Board’s Electronic and Information Technology
Accessibility Standards at 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1194.
The contractor shall identify all EIT products and services provided,
identify the technical standards applicable to all products and services
proposed, and state the degree of compliance with the applicable
standards. Additionally, the contractor must clearly indicate where the
information pertaining to Section 508 compliance can be found (e.g.,
Vendor’s or other exact web page location). The contractor must ensure
that the list is easily accessible by typical users beginning at time of
award.


## Submission Instructions

Quotes shall be submitted through GSA eBuy at
[*www.eBuy.gsa.gov*](http://www.ebuy.gsa.gov). Late quotes and quotes
not submitted through GSA eBuy will not be accepted or evaluated, unless
otherwise noted. The electronic time stamp on quotes submitted through
GSA eBuy shall determine timeliness of quote submission. The contractor
must submit quotes by the date and time established in the RFQ notice
posted on GSA eBuy. If you are unable to attach your quote to GSA eBuy
due to some type of technical difficulty, you must report the problem to
raymond.mccollum@gsa.gov in sufficient time prior to closing to allow
for the submission of the quote via an alternative method.

NOTE: Failure to register properly with GSA eBuy is not an acceptable
excuse for the inability to submit a quote. If a contractor decides to
submit a “No Bid” in response to the RFQ, GSA requests that it provide
the reasons for opting not to participate.

The contractor must submit all industry questions concerning this RFQ to
raymond.mccollum@gsa.gov by the questions suspense date identified on
GSA eBuy for the RFQ. The Contracting Officer (CO) will compile all
questions and responses and will publish questions and responses within
a reasonable timeframe giving particular consideration to quote
submission due date and time. The only method by which any term of the
RFQ may be modified is by a formal amendment to the RFQ generated by the
GSA CO. No other communication made, whether oral or in writing (e.g.,
at any Pre-Quote conference, Industry questions and responses prior to
response closing date and time, clarifications, etc.), will modify or
supersede the terms of the RFQ. The Government reserves the right to
make a selection based upon initial quotes; therefore the Quoter should
submit its best terms in its initial quote.

In posing questions, potential Quoters must cite the relevant section,
paragraph, and page number. Questions should be written in a way that
enables clear understanding of the potential Quoter’s issues or
concerns. Statements expressing opinions, sentiments, or conjectures are
not considered valid inquiries and will not receive a response. Further,
potential Quoters are reminded that the CO will not address hypothetical
questions aimed at receiving a potential “evaluation decision.” All
questions and answers issued by the Government shall be disseminated to
all potential Quoters in the form of a solicitation amendment.

Quoters are expected to examine this entire RFQ document. Failure to do
so will be at the Quoter's own risk. By submitting a quote, each Quoter
is representing that its firm will perform all the requirements
specified in the RFQ and therefore it is not necessary or desirable that
this be repeated in its quote. Quotes shall set forth full, accurate,
and complete information as required by this solicitation package
(including Attachments). The penalty for making false statements in
quotations is prescribed in 18 U.S.C. 1001.

The Quoter must be a current GSA IT Schedule 70 Contract holder with
Special Item Numbers (SINs) 132-40 (Cloud Computing Services) and SIN
132-51 (IT Professional Services) and have the proposed items awarded
under its Schedule contract at the time of its quote submission. If a
Contractor Teaming Arrangement (CTA) is proposed, all parties shall have
current GSA IT Schedule 70 Contracts. All parties’ GSA IT Schedule 70
Contracts must cover the BPA’s estimated ordering period, which is five
years from the date of the BPA award. If the Quoter’s contract does not
currently include SIN 132-40, the GSA IT Schedule 70 Program will allow
the Quoter to participate in the FASt Lane Program,[^3] provided that
the Quoter meets one of the following criteria:

-   New Offer Proposal; or

-   Contract Modification (including options);

Only quotes which include products, services, or solutions on an
underlying GSA IT Schedule 70 contract and the associated pricing will
be considered for award. Any modifications to a GSA IT Schedule 70
contractor’s contract to incorporate quoted offerings must occur prior
to the RFQ closing date. Quoters shall specify any proposed discounts
(standard and/or non-standard), which shall remain in place for the life
of the BPA.

This RFQ does not obligate the Government to pay any costs incurred in
the submission of any proposal or in making necessary studies for the
preparation thereof, nor does it obligate the Government to procure or
contract for said services. Upon receipt, all quotes become Government
property and shall not be returned.

The Quoter shall state any assumptions and exceptions to the
requirements, terms, and conditions contained in this Request for
Quotation (RFQ). Please note that any exceptions to the requirements of
this BPA may adversely affect the evaluation of the quote and the quote
may be deemed unacceptable.

Quotes should specifically address all of the following elements:

| Payroll              | 2 hours plus 20 minutes for Questions                 | 
| Both: WSLM & Payroll | 4 hours plus 40 minutes for Questions                 | 

**NOTE** – If Quoter is demonstrating both WSLM and Payroll a 10 minute
break will be taken between demonstrations.

The Government will provide scenarios that allow Quoters to describe
and/or demonstrate their SaaS Solutions configurability. The Quoter
shall demonstrate their business capabilities through “out-of-the-box”
configurations and how they meet the Government’s needs. The
demonstration case scenarios may consist of the following elements:

-   The flexibility of the product to meet Federal Integrated Business Framework (FIBF) capabilities through configuration;

-   The flexibility of the product to be configured to accommodate changes in legislation, policy, and procedures;

-   The extent the solution can be configured by the SSPs;

-   How the solution adapts to changing requirements and looks at ways to continuously provide better customer service and quality;

-   Payroll: Accuracy of the gross, net, allowances, differentials, premiums, pay caps, and deductions (order of precedence) as demonstrated by a leave and earnings statement for payroll;

-   Payroll: Process for certification of payroll prior to submission to the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) for funds disbursement;

-   Payroll: Accuracy of the computation of leave balances and application of business rules to include FMLA/FLSA, etc.

-   WSLM: Accuracy of WSLM solution to appropriately categorize and capture hours worked, leave taken, and leave accrued; and

-   WSLM: Process for certification of WSLM prior to submission to Payroll solution for computation of pay; and

-   The demonstration shall describe process(es) for accessing the Payroll and WSLM data required to compute multi-year retro pay.

#### Phase 4 - Pricing

All prices proposed in response to this RFQ shall be in accordance with
the instructions in this section. Quoters shall complete in its entirety
all of the pricing tables in **Attachment H - Pricing **

##### Evaluation Criteria

###### Basis for Award

The basis for award for this BPA will be a best value determination
considering both technical and price. When combined, all technical
factors combined are significantly more important than price; however,
as quotes become more equal in their technical merit, price becomes more
important. The Government will perform a price/technical tradeoff
analysis in accordance with the above criteria and select the Quoters
that provide the best value.

Phase

A price evaluation will only be evaluated for Quoters with a Technical
Approach (includes Attachment A - Business Capabilities and Data
Standards, Attachment B - Technical Capabilities, Attachment C - FEDRamp
Self-Assessment Moderate/High, and Attachment F - VPAT Self Assessment,
Program Management Approach, Software Maintenance, Implementation
Support, Past Performance and Project Experience (Attachment E -
Corporate Experience and Past Performance Reference Sheet) receiving the
appropriate ratings levels in each factor as specified above and have
conducted a Solution Capability Demonstration and Oral Presentation. The
Government intends to make an award without discussions, but reserves
the right to conduct discussions if deemed necessary. Award may be made
to other than the lowest-price technically acceptable quote. This RFQ
will be conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4 ordering procedures
as the BPA will be established against a Federal Supply Schedule (FSS)
contract. The policies and procedures of FAR Part 15 shall not apply.

Unless all quotes are rejected, the Government will establish a multiple
award BPA to the responsible Quoters whose quote/submission conforming
to the RFQ is determined to be a best value solution. The Government’s
objective is to obtain the highest technical capability considered
necessary to achieve the project objectives within a reasonable cost.
The Government intends to award to at least two Quoters will be selected
for each pool (a. Payroll, b. WSLM, and c. Both – Payroll and WSLM).

Quotes shall be evaluated in accordance with the following factors,
listed in descending order of importance:

-   Phase 3: Solution Capability Demonstration and Oral Presentation

-   Phase 2: Technical Approach

    -   Phase 2, Part A –Technical Approach (includes Attachment A -
        Business Capabilities and Data Standards, Attachment B -
        Technical Capabilities, Attachment C - FEDRamp Self-Assessment
        Moderate/High), and Attachment F - VPAT)

    -   Phase 2, Part B – Program Management Approach

    -   Phase 2, Part C – Software Maintenance

    -   Phase 2, Part D – Implementation Support

    -   Phase 2, Part E - Past Performance (Attachment E - Corporate
        Experience and Past Performance Reference Sheet)

    -   Phase 2, Part G - Small Business Subcontracting Plan
        (if applicable)

-   Phase 1: Solution Conformance

-   Phase 4: Price

If any of the evaluation factors receives a rating of less than
acceptable and satisfactory, the Quote shall not receive any further
consideration and will not be considered for award.

##### Phase 1: Solution Conformance

The Government will evaluate all written quotes submitted. Written
quotes submitted in Phase 1 factors are considered
acceptable/unacceptable. All Quoters whose quotes are determined to be
acceptable (pass) in Phase 1 for Solution Conformance and Corporate
Experience will be evaluated in Phase 2.

##### Phase 2: Outstanding/Good/Satisfactory/Unacceptable

-   Phase 2, Part A –Technical Approach (includes Attachment A -
    Business Capabilities and Data Standards, Attachment B - Technical
    Capabilities, Attachment C - FEDRamp Self-Assessment Moderate/High),
    and Attachment F - VPAT Self Assessment)

-   Phase 2, Part B – Program Management Approach

-   Phase 2, Part C – Software Maintenance

-   Phase 2, Part D – Implementation Support

-   Phase 2, Part E - Past Performance (Attachment E - Corporate
    Experience and Past Performance Reference Sheet)

-   Phase 2, Part G - Small Business Subcontracting Plan (if applicable)

Phase 2, Part A - Technical Approach is of equal importance to Phase 2,
Part B - Program Management Approach and are significantly more
important than Phase 2, Part C - Software Maintenance, Phase 2, Part D -
Implementation Support, and Phase 2, Part E - Corporate Experience and
Past Performance Reference Sheet. Phase 2, Part G - Small Business
Subcontracting Plan (if applicable) shall be evaluated on Pass/Fail):
The Quoters will be evaluated on the ability to address the Government’s
requirement listed in the Technical Approach section under Submission
Requirements and Attachment A - Business Capabilities and Data
Standards, Attachment B - Technical Capabilities, Attachment C - FEDRamp
Self-Assessment Moderate/High, and Attachment F - VPAT Self Assessment
within this RFQ. The Quoters shall be evaluated on the content of the
Technical Approach components, which will serve as evidence of their
understanding of the Government's requirements. The Quoters shall also
be evaluated for compliance based on the response to each attachment
listed under Phase 2, Part A - Technical Approach within this RFQ.

Phase 2, Part B - Program Management Approach: The Quoters will be
evaluated on the content and completeness of their Program Management
Approach, which will serve as evidence of their understanding of the
Government's requirements. The Government is specifically interested in
a clear and concise discussion of the Quoter’s methodology to achieve
the BPA’s requirements rather than a restatement of the SOO. The
evaluation will include an analysis of the Quoter’s capabilities and
expertise relevant to deploying successfully the proposed management
approach. The quote will be evaluated for effective lines of
communication and authority, mechanisms to ensure that client concerns
are addressed in a timely and responsive manner, and procedures in place
to address disciplinary, ethical, or performance concerns. This section
will be evaluated for compliance based on the Program Management
Approach under Submission Requirements within this RFQ.

Phase 2 Part C - Software Maintenance, Phase 2, Part D - Implementation
Support, and Phase 2, Part E - Past Performance and Project Experience
are of equal importance.The Quoters will be evaluated on the following:

Phase 2, Part C - Software Maintenance: The Government shall evaluate
the Quoter’s schedule for baseline upgrades, responsiveness to defect
resolutions and ability to ensure requested changes benefit the greater
user population. The Government shall evaluate the Quoter’s description
of these services to ensure the procured solutions remain true to SaaS
and do not become customized for government and reflect legacy
technology, omitting the benefits to be derived from SaaS. The
Government shall evaluate the Quoter’s ability to process rolling
Government requested changes into product roadmap. The Government shall
evaluate the Quoter’s investment in their product (how often do they
have a major version update). The Government shall evaluate the Quoter’s
process for identifying and fixing defects and responsiveness to
customer reported defects.

Phase 2 Part D- Implementation Support: The Government will evaluate the
Quoter’s implementation strategy based on their ability to demonstrate
comprehensive identification of required activities for implementation
strategy. The Government will evaluate strengths and weaknesses for
those activities, timelines, milestones, deliverables, and interface
solutions identified for comprehensiveness, realism, and value added to
the Government’s requirement.

The Government shall evaluate the Quoter’s strategy for data integration
services support. The Government will evaluate the supported and
unsupported system infrastructures against the Government’s legacy
applications for HR and FM. The Government shall evaluate the APIs
available for Government use and the identified purpose of these APIs.

The Government will evaluate the Quoter’s core configuration support for
comprehensive set-up and management of configuration items to meet the
Government’s business capabilities. The Government shall evaluate the
strategy for the configuration services support, which would include
Core (services for comprehensive set-up and management of configuration
items to meet the government’s business capabilities) and any Optional
Services.

The Government shall evaluate the Quoter’s strategy for providing
Training Support Services, training materials and programs used to
ensure that all users can use the systems based on their assigned roles
(e.g., current payroll providers and agencies obtaining WSLM systems.)
The Government shall evaluate the Help Desk support for technical and
configuration support and User Support and Management.

Phase 2 Part E: Past Performance and Project Experience: The Government
shall evaluate the Quoter’s past performance for similarities in
complexity, size, regulatory requirements, and security sensitivities.
The Quoter shall be evaluated on their creativity, success, and
strategies to overcome identified challenges in past performance
implementations. Past performance shall be evaluated as a measure of the
Government’s confidence in the Quoter’s ability to successfully perform
to include effectively manage resources, meet performance requirements,
and ensure customer satisfaction. The Quoter shall include a brief
description and dollar value of similar projects completed similar to
the scale of this procurement. Each project reference shall be able to
confirm the type of work performed and level of performance for each
project submitted.

Phase 2, Part G: Small Business Subcontracting Plan: Quoters that are
large businesses must establish a subcontracting plan with specific
dollar and percent goals for subcontracting to small, HUBZone small,
small disadvantaged, small women-owned, veteran-owned small, and
service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms. This plan must be
in place prior to contract award. The Small Business Subcontracting Plan
must be compliant with FAR 52.219-9.

#### Phase 3: Solution Capability Demonstration and Oral Presentation:

The Demonstration will be used to assess the Quoter’s capability in
satisfying the requirements set forth within this RFQ. The Demonstration
and Oral Presentation will be given at facilities designated by the
federal government. The Demonstration and Oral Presentation shall
include the following sub-factor components

Business Demonstration Cases: The Quoter’s shall be able to describe and
demonstrate the business capabilities through “out-of-the-box”
configurations and how they meet the Government’s needs. The Government
will evaluate based on the Quoter’s description and/or demonstration of
the business capabilities and demonstration case scenarios. The
Government will create and evaluate scenarios in the following elements:

-   Accuracy of the gross, net, deductions (order of precedence) as demonstrated by a leave and earnings statement;

-   The flexibility of the product to meet FIBF capabilities through configuration;

-   The flexibility of the product to be configured to accommodate changes in legislation, policy, and procedures;

-   The extent the solution can be configured by the SSPs;

-   Process for certification of payroll prior to submission to Treasury for funds disbursement;

-   Optional services that exist to support customer specific configuration items (ease with which the Government can request additional configuration items that might be identified).

-   How the solution adapts to changing requirements and looks at ways to continuously provide better customer service and quality; and,

-   The accuracy and timeliness of real-time or batch transactions.

#### Price Evaluation

Price will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 8.404(d). As such, GSA
will verify that offered items are within the scope of the Quoter’s GSA
IT Schedule 70 contract. Price quotes will be checked to verify current
pricing, including any applicable discounts, and evaluated for price
reasonableness in accordance with the requirements of FAR 8.405-2(d).
Price will be evaluated separate from all non-price elements of the
quote. The Government reserves the right to seek a price reduction from
any or all Quoters in accordance with FAR 8.405-4.

A price evaluation will only be done for offerors receiving an overall
rating of ACCEPTABLE or higher in Phase 1, 2, and 3. All evaluation
factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more
important than price*.* Award may be made to the offeror whose quote is
determined be the best value for the Government.

#### Open Season

The Government reserves the right to conduct an open season, if it is it
determined to be in the best interest of the government.
